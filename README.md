#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was to take iput from the user and calculate compounding interest, then output that interest in a table to them.

#What did you do particularly well?
I was able to calculate the interest correctly. I was also able to refactor the code well so it was cleaner.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
My table wasn't as nice I would have liked. I also felt like I ran out of time so I wasn't able to complete everything I was asked to do.
My inprovements would make the output more readable to the user. It would also make the code more readable. 

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I felt I did not completely capture the point of the header. I definitely felt I used it because it was there but did not utilize it to the best of my ability. 
I also had trouble with the math portion. I was not returning the correct number which cause the whole table to be off. 

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The skills that will trasnfer is just knowing I need more time on a project. Also, the ability to work through a problem and have patience with myself as I need to refactor and change my code. The first time is never perfect and it is ok to fail.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I refactored my functions. At the beginning I had several functions that did similar things. I took those and combinded them, but then put exception catchers in place to be able to filter the different choices. I also added comments in to help with the readability and maintenance of the code.
